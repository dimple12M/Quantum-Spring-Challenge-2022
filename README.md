# IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022


This year challenge was very interesting because it was based on one of the application domain of quantum computing.

"Quantum Chemistry"

## Exrecise 1:
 In this exercise, learned about the trotterization related through the "Tight-binding" model. 
 
 To understand trotterization:
 
 Lecture 5.2 of QGSS 2021 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpLzSQPrgSc&t=2070s
 
## Exercise 2:

In this , continue with the exercise 1 and explore on Quantum Random walk and localization 


## Exercise 3:

In this, studied thermalization and von-neumann entropy through "many body quantum dynamics"


## Exercise 4:

Explore Quantum chemistry using Qiskit Nature
